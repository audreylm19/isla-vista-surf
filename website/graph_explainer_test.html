        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <div>
        <p>I chose the same color scheme that Surfline uses to distinguish conditions. Gray represents a score of zero, blue a score of one, green a score of two, orange a score of three, and red a score of four. An hour’s total score is the number of ideal wind, tide, period, and swell conditions met according to the following metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If either of the below conditions are met, an hour’s wind is considered ideal</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Any wind speed between 0mph and 4mph</li>
                <li>Wind speed between 5mph and 10mph if wind direction is between 0 and 57 degrees</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If both of the below conditions are met, an hour’s swell is considered ideal</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Swell direction between 258 and 304 degrees</li>
                <li>Swell Height between 1m and 3m</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tide between 2ft and 5ft is considered ideal</li>
            <li>Period over 8 seconds is considered ideal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hours without sufficient data are colored yellow.</p>

        <h2>Yearly Stacked Bar Graph</h2>
        <p>Each bar represents the total daylight hours in a year separated by score. Eventually, clicking on a bar will lead you to that year’s corresponding hover graph, but for now you’ll just see the total hours in each color block. </p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="stacked-bar" width=100% height=100% frameborder="0" src="version_2.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h2>Monthly Hover Graph</h2>
        <p>Each brick you see represents a single daylight hour, and hovering over a brick will show that hour’s exact wind, swell, tide, and period.</p>
        <p>This bar graph is actually a scatter plot in disguise&mdash;in order to preserve each hour’s conditions I manually assigned every hour an x-y position to form a bar graph. For this reason, I’ve omitted the y-axis, since the area of each color block represents a score’s total hours rather than the block’s height. You can see this area next to “total hours with this score” in the hover display.</p>
